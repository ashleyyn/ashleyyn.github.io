<h1>Ashley Nguyen's Art Portfolio</h1>
   <p>  <b>Welcome!</b> The purpose of this website is to show some of my art I have created and the story behind them. I have used plenty of different mediums throughout my artist life such as clay, marker, pencil, color pencil, arcylic paint, oil paint, wire, oil pastel, charcoal, and chalk pastel. Having this website that can have all my art pieces in one place, makes it easier to access my pieces, and to show them off to people if they ask about what pieces I have done. All of my art pieces ranges from 5-20 hours of work to complete. These are all of <b> my art pieces</b> that I have created over the years: </p>
<h2> Art Pieces: </h2>
  <h3> Bottles </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Downloads/Photos/IMG_0742.jpg" alt="bottles" width="500" height="600" class="center">
  <p>This is a still object interpretation of wine, beer, and cheese. My father is a whiskey and cognac collector and my parents love to wine. I used empty bottles of beer and wine around my house as my inspiration, and created a more abstract interpretation of the bottles. (Marker and Pen)</p>
  <h3> Goldfish </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Pictures/goldfishbag.jpg" alt="goldfish" width="500" height="600">
  <p>I created this art piece to be a depiction of what it looks like when someone first purchases a goldfish as a pet. It usually comes home in a plastic bag filled with water, but in this case, the goldfish is in a plastic bag filled with trash. At first, many would not realize there is a goldfish in the art piece, but on further inspection, you can spot the goldfish right front and center. I did this on purpose to show that some trash in the ocean, at first sight, may seem like a fish or some ocean creature, but it is trash. (Color Pencil,Marker, and Pen)</p>

  <h3> Gradiation </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Downloads/Art%20/New%20Folder%20With%20Items/IMG_0510.jpg" alt="gradiation" width = "500" height="600">
  <p> This is a gradiation practice piece for me. I was exploring how gradiation would look on different shapes and sizes. (Charcoal) </p>
  <h3> Color Blob </h3> 
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Pictures/blobcolor.jpg" alt="blob" width = "500" height="600">
  <p> I used a similar method of gradiation but instead of using charcoal, which is easier to creat the ombre effect, I used different color pencils to create the ombre effect. (Color Pencil) </p>
  <h3> The Crying Boy </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Pictures/cryingboy.jpg" alt="boy" width="500" height="600">
  <p> This was my first ever try on drawing a realistic portrait. I used the grid method to make sure I had the correct proportions. I used an inspiration photo from the internet. The photogropher that took the photo of the boy is Bruce Gilden. The linked to the article I found this photo is: https://time.com/fair-faced/. (Color Pencil) </p>
