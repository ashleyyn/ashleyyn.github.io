<h1>Ashley Nguyen's Art Portfolio</h1>
   <p>  <b>Welcome!</b> The purpose of this website is to showcase some of the art I have created and the story behind it. I have used plenty of different mediums throughout my artist era such as clay, marker, pencil, colored pencil, acrylic paint, oil paint, wire, oil pastel, charcoal, and chalk pastel. Having this website allows me to have all my art pieces in one place, makes it easier to access my pieces, and to show them to people if they ask about what pieces I have done. All of my art pieces range from 5 to 20 hours of work to complete. These are all of <b> my art pieces</b> that I have created over the years: </p>
<h2> Art Pieces: </h2>
  <h3> Bottles </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Downloads/Photos/IMG_0742.jpg" alt="bottles" width="500" height="600" class="center">
  <p>This is a still object interpretation of wine, beer, and cheese. My parents love to drink wine. I used empty bottles of beer and wine around my house as my inspiration and created a more abstract interpretation of the bottles. (Marker and Pen)</p>
  <h3> Goldfish </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Pictures/goldfishbag.jpg" alt="goldfish" width="500" height="600">
  <p>I created this art piece to be a depiction of what it looks like when someone first purchases a goldfish as a pet. It usually comes home in a plastic bag filled with water, but in this case, the goldfish is in a plastic bag filled with trash. At first, many would not realize there is a goldfish in the art piece, but on further inspection, you can spot the goldfish right front and center. I did this on purpose to show that some trash in the ocean, at first sight, may seem like a fish or some ocean creature, but it is trash. (Color Pencil, Marker, and Pen)</p>

  <h2>The Jazz Band</h2>
  <p> These art pieces were inspired by the Harlem Renaissance era, specifically by the artist Charles Alston. This painting depicts a Jazz Band. There are 3 pieces in my collection. In the future, my goal is to add more to the collection. (Acrylic Paint and Paint Marker)</p>
  <h3> The Saxophonist </h3>

  <h3> Gradiation </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Downloads/Art%20/New%20Folder%20With%20Items/IMG_0510.jpg" alt="gradiation" width = "500" height="600">
  <p> This is a gradiation practice piece for me. I was exploring how gradiation would look on different shapes and sizes. (Charcoal) </p>
  <h3> Color Blob </h3> 
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Pictures/blobcolor.jpg" alt="blob" width = "500" height="600">
  <p> I used a similar method of gradiation but instead of using charcoal, which is easier to create the ombre effect, I used different colored pencils to create the ombre effect. (Color Pencil) </p>
  <h3> The Crying Boy </h3>
<img src="file:///Users/ashleynguyen/Pictures/cryingboy.jpg" alt="boy" width= "485" height="600">
  <p> This was my first ever try on drawing a realistic portrait. I used the grid method to make sure I had the correct proportions. I used an inspiration photo from the internet. The photographer who took the photo of the boy is Bruce Gilden. The link to the article I found in this photo is: https://time.com/fair-faced/. (Color Pencil) </p>
